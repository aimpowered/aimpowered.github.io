# Use AI to autotune audio and videos with atypical speech

## Auto-tuning Audio with Speech Disfluency

Original audio recording of speech with disfluency:

<audio controls>
<source src="assets/media/short_intro.wav">
Audio element failed...
</audio>

Original transcription (there are lots of um's): 

> Hi my name is Shaomei Wu and I, um, worked at Facebook. Um, my research is at the intersection of, um, AI and, um, accessibility. So I try to build empowering AI, um, technology for marginalized communities. 

Autotuned version:

<audio controls>
<source src="assets/media/de_filler_short_intro.wav">
Audio element failed...
</audio>

## Auto-tuning Video with Speech Disfluency

Original video recording of me speaking (12 sec):

<!-- - [Original Video, 12sec](assets/media/intro_video_short.mp4) -->

<video controls height="400">
<source src="assets/media/intro_video_short.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Video rendering failed...
</video>

<br>

Autotuned version (10 sec):

<!-- - [Auto-tuned Video, 10sec](assets/media/autotuned_intro_video_short.mp4) -->

<video controls height="400">
<source src="assets/media/autotuned_intro_video_short.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
