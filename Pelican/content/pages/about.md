AImpower.org is a tech non-profit that dedicates to build innovative,  empowering AI technologies **for** and **with** marginalized communities.


We will deconstruct the mainstream AI research by centering on the margin and oriented the training, testing, and deployment of AI models from the needs of marginalized and low-resourced groups. We view photos taken by the blind or speech sample of the stutters are not noise or outliers but the primary problems our models will be trained to understand and solve.

Our principles are:


- **Human centered AI**: while most AI researchers focus on pushing metrics on standardized datasets, we will partner with the target community and centered their needs and inputs in the tech development.

- **Lifting the marginalized**: while most of the tech industry focuses on serving the largest possible market, we will explicitly focus on marginalized communities, spend 100% of our energy to serve them well.

- **Partnership**: Equippep and experienced with both community connections and technical expertise, we are eager to partner with different organizations that have been traditionally disconnected.
