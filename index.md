AImpower.org is a tech non-profit that is dedicated to build innovative,
empowering AI technologies **for** and **with** marginalized communities.
For example, leveraging vision/speech/language models to build new tools for people with visual impairment, people with speech/hearing impairment, and people with language challenges (e.g. dyslexia, aphasia).


Our principles are:

- **Human centered AI**: while most AI researchers focus on pushing metrics on standardized datasets, we will partner with the community and center their needs and inputs in the tech development.

- **Lifting the marginalized**: while most of the tech industry focuses on serving the largest possible market, we will explicitly focus on marginalized communities, spend 100% of our energy to serve them well.

- **Partnership**: Equipped and experienced with both community connections and technical expertise, we are eager to partner with organizations that have been traditionally disconnected.
