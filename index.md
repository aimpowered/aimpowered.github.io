AImpower.org is a tech non-profit that is dedicated to evaluate and envision new and existing technologies **for** and **with** marginalized communities to dismantle barriers and deliver tangible benefits. 

## What do we do
 
The scope of our work include (but not limited to):
- Research and identify structural barriers for a community in specific technological contexts. For example, we work with people who stutter to uncover systematic issues in speech-related technologies and voice controlled systems.

- Evaluate existing technologies, especially ML/AI powered technologies, to understand their biases and gaps for marginalized user groups, as well as the impact of such biases and gaps online and offline. For example, we will work with people with dyslexia to measure the degraded performance they experience with machine translations and spelling suggestions.   

- Identify opportunities for current and future technologies to close the equity gap for minority and marginalized communities who have been left behind. For example, we will envison the opportunities for computer vision technologies to empower the lives of people with visual impairements.

- Create technical solutions to make existing technologies more inclusive and enjoyable for marginalized users. For example, tuning speech recognition models to enable people with atypical speech to interact with them more easiliy.

- Design and develop new, empowering technologies with marginalized communities.
For example, we may design a camera-based "personal stylist" app with the visually impaired community to empower people in pursuit of their fashion and cosmetics goals.

- Advise and support marginalized communities on technical issues. For example, scoping and evaluating technical systems needed by the community; organizing collective resistance to technical systems deployed without the consent of the community. 


## Our principles

- **Community oriented, NOT technology oriented.**  We believe research and development of technology should center the experiences and needs of marginalized communities, and should be driven by the goals of the communities, rather than the technology itself. 

- **Build for empowerment, NOT charity.**  We believe in the power and capacities of the communities we serve, and consider technology a means for self-efficacy. We will not optimize for time spent or user growth with our technology, but design for long-term economic, emotional and social outcomes for the communities we work with.

- **Proactive & pragmatic, NOT complicit.**  We operate based on the best interest of the community we serve, and will not submit to external pressure when it disaligns with our principles and mission.

- **Open and transparent.**  We publish our research and open source our technical work whenever possible. We will not let monetary costs stop marginalized communities from participating in and taking advantage of our work.

- **Kind and respectful.** We treat our team members and partners kindly and respectfully. We embrace authenticity and vulnerability. We prioritize the well-being of our staff and people we work with. We respect each otherâ€™s boundaries, values, and priorities.
